Lunar Lander
============

This is a lunar lander game I wrote while high school. It was based on a number
of [mode 13h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h) tutorials and an earlier
lunar lander game in [HyperTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk).

It was developed using Borland C++ 2.0 on a 486, and will still build under
Borland C++ or Turbo C inside DosBOX.
